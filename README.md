Github, Google, AWS, and others provides you a way to enhance your account security.

You still have to anter your usual password, but an additional 6 digit token, is needed
for login. It generated by using a device either a physycal one, or an app on you phone.

alias totp-aws='totp -clipboard $AWS_MFA_TOKEN'
alias totp-slack='totp -clipboard $SLACK_2FA_TOKEN'
```
